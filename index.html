        Scenario<br>
        Several people are standing in a row divided into two teams.<br>
        The first person goes into team 1, the second goes into team 2, <br>
        the third goes into team 1, and so on.<br>
        <br>
        Task<br>
        Given an array of positive integers (the weights of the people),<br>
        return a new array/tuple of two integers, where the first one is <br>
        the total weight of team 1, and the second one is the total weight <br>
        of team 2.<br>
        <br>
        Notes<br>
        Array size is at least 1.<br>
        All numbers will be positive<br>
